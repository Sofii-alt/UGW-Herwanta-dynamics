This project is a modular robotics system designed for autonomous (hopefully) outdoor navigation and .....
The robot consists of the following main components:

- **Hardware:** motors, battery, sensors (LIDAR, encoders)
- **Software:** mapping, control, mission planning
- **Documentation:** plans, sketches, and test results

The goal is to create a reliable system for mapping rooms and executing predefined tasks autonomously.
