# Rover Project – Autonomous Mapping and Paintball System

Welcome to our student rover project! This is a small-group work-in-progress autonomous ground robot that can map its surroundings, navigate, and has a paintball/marking system on top.

The aim is to combine mechanical design, control systems, mapping, and system integration, while learning real-world robotics skills.
Note: Everyone contributes a bit across the teams since this is a small student project.

# Robot showcase
Here is what our rower plans look like. Dosen't yet have the paintball mount:




# Project goals
- Build a rover that can map rooms or outdoor areas using LIDAR, wheel encoders, and IMU
- Enable basic navigation and control with Raspberry Pi 4 + Pixhawk 6C
- Mount a paintball/marking system for testing targeting and actuation
- Learn how to integrate mechanical, electrical, and software systems
- Future goal: robust rover for forestry or rough terrain, autonomously marking trees and mapping areas

# Teams and Members
## Team 1 – Mechanical
Members:
- Veeti → calculations and desine
- Aatu → 3D renderings and desine
- Responsibilities: chassis, motors, encoders, battery, electronics, mechanical stability

## Team 2 – Paintball/marking system 
Members:
- Leo → design & actuation of paintball system
- Responsibilities: mount and test marking system, work with mechanical team

## Team 3 – Mapping + controls + system Integration 
Members:
- Sofia → mapping, localization, ROS2, mission planning
- Eelis → motor control, integration, sensor diagnostics
- Responsibilities: SLAM, navigation, motor control, sensor integration, system testing

Everyone contributes across teams – collaboration is key!

# Current progress (placeholder for updates)
- Mechanical: chassis desined, 3D renderings available
- Electrical: motor/battery calculations in progress
- Software: Linux + ArduPilot + ROS2 installed, repo structure ready
- Mapping & Control: placeholders ready for logs and scripts

Progress updates:



# Repository structure
- design_sketches/ -> mechanical concepts and 3D renderings
- hardware/ -> motors, battery, sensors, calculations, wiring diagrams
- software/ -> control, mapping, mission planning, tests
- tests/ -> logs, sensor diagnostics, signal checks
- budget.xlsx -> ongoing cost calculations

# Future goals
- Build a robust chassis for rough/forest terrain
- Fully autonomous navigation system
- Map and navigate marked areas for forestry applications
- Use this project as a foundation for Bachelor’s or Master’s thesis
- Showcase videos of mapping and navigation in action
